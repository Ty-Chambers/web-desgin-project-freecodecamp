            <p> The Combined Aesthetic of anime and manga may be Japan's greatest and most influential
                cultural export, but it wouldn't exist without one man - a man who looms over Japanese
             pop culture and who is known throughout Japan as it's most legendary modern artist. That man
             is Osamu, frequently nicknamed the "God of Manga", the "Godfather of Anime," and the "Walt Disney of Japan."

               Always arrayed in a beret, thick-rimmed glasses, and a smile, Tezuka was an artistic
               genius who created more than 700 manga titles - comprising 150,000 pages of hand-drawn art - and 
               more than 60 anime in his lifetime, making him one of the most prolific Japanese manga creators in history. 
               The impact of Tezuka's career on Japanese culture far exceeds his actual artistry, though his artistry is 
               incredibly influential. But of equal importance is his role in creating the longstanding industry around 
               taking Japanese comics, or manga, developing them into animated Japanese TV series, or anime, exporting 
               them around the globe.
