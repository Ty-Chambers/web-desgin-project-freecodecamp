          <h2>Our Mission is to Spread Awareness of Mental Health</h2>
        <blockqoute cite="https://www.mentalhealthresource.org.uk/facts-and-figures">
                    1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year in England.<br>

          <h2> Our Work</h2>
          <h3> Our Mission</h3>
          <p> Our goal is to raise mental health awareness to help people to understand their symptoms, and to find professional treatment, and, perhaps most importantly, break the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret. 
      Our team state that their favorite thing about the job is that they are changing lives. Helping people learn to manage their condition and live a healthy life is extremely rewarding and can keep a person happy with their job. Those who work with kids and help people transition from a psychiatric hospital enjoy the feeling of success that comes from helping someone improve their life. If this is appealing to you, mental health may be your ideal career path.
